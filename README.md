# **Classifying Retinal Images for Diabetic Retinopathy using Vision Transformers**

This project focuses on developing and evaluating deep learning models for the automated classification of retinal fundus images to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). It explores the effectiveness of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and state-of-the-art [Vision Transformers (ViT)](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224) in this medical imaging task, with a particular emphasis on improving generalization and performance on minority classes.

## **‚ú® Key Features**

* **Diabetic Retinopathy Classification:** Automated detection of DR from retinal fundus images.  
* **Comparative Model Analysis:** Comprehensive comparison between CNN (EfficientNetB0) and [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224) architectures.  
* **Advanced Fine-tuning:** Implementation of fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained ViT models to optimize performance on medical images.  
* **Robust Data Preprocessing & Augmentation:** Utilizes TensorFlow for efficient image handling and augmentation to enhance model generalization.

## **üíª How to Run (General Steps)**

1. Set Up Environment:

```bash
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.  
conda create \-n dr\_env python=3.9  
conda activate dr\_env  
\# or  
python \-m venv dr\_env  
source dr\_env/bin/activate  
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install \-r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: A requirements.txt file is typical for listing all Python dependencies.)*

3. Download Dataset:  
   Obtain the IDRiD dataset from its official source (often requires registration or agreement to terms of use). Place the images and labels in a designated data/ directory.  
4. Run Jupyter Notebook/Scripts:  
   Execute the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## **üìÅ Dataset Information**

This project primarily utilizes the [**IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset)**](https://idrid.grand-challenge.org/Data/), a publicly available dataset specifically curated for diabetic retinopathy detection and grading. It provides retinal fundus images along with corresponding ground truth labels for DR severity.
